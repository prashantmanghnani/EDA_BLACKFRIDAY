# EDA_BLACKFRIDAY


Welcome to the EDA and Feature Engineering project for the Black Friday dataset! This project aims to explore and analyze the Black Friday dataset, and to perform feature engineering on the data to prepare it for machine learning models.

Dataset
The Black Friday dataset is a retail data set that contains information about purchase transactions made during the Black Friday sales event. It includes information about the product purchased, the price paid, and other demographic information about the customer. The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle.

EDA
The first step in this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Black Friday dataset. This involves:

Importing and cleaning the data
Visualizing the data to get a better understanding of the distributions and relationships between different variables
Identifying any missing or incorrect data, and handling these issues
Calculating summary statistics for the data
Feature Engineering
Once the EDA has been completed, the next step is to perform feature engineering on the data. This involves:

Selecting relevant features for the machine learning model
Encoding categorical variables
Scaling numeric variables
Handling missing values
Next Steps
After completing the EDA and feature engineering, the data is ready to be fed into a machine learning model. The next steps in the project will involve training and evaluating a model using the prepared data.

Project Structure
The project is organized into the following files and directories:

data/: directory containing the raw Black Friday dataset
notebooks/: directory containing Jupyter notebooks with the EDA and feature engineering code
reports/: directory containing reports and visualizations generated during the EDA and feature engineering process
src/: directory containing any helper functions or scripts used in the project
Requirements
To run the code in this project, you will need the following packages:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
You may also need additional packages depending on your machine learning model of choice.

Running the Code
To run the code in this project, follow these steps:

Install the required packages (see above)
Download the Black Friday dataset from Kaggle and place it in the data/ directory
Open the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory and follow the instructions in the notebooks to perform EDA and feature engineering on the data
Use the prepared data to train and evaluate a machine learning model of your choice.
